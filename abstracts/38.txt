In order to make requirements comprehensible to humans and as unambiguous as possible, a glossary and/or domain model is needed for defining the terminology used. Unless these are available from related projects, however,they are hard to create. Therefore, we propose to reuse terminology and its definition for requirements specifications from the semantic lexicon WordNet. For making this useful, however, we had to deal with the issue of disambiguation of the general terminology there for a given domain of a requirements specification.
