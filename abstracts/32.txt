Heterogeneously-licensed systems pose new challenges to analysts and system architects. Appropriate intellectual property rights must be available for the installed system, but without unnecessarily restricting other requirements, the system architecture, and the choice of components both initially and as it evolves. Such systems are increasingly common and important in e-business, game development, and other domains. Our semantic parameterization analysis of open-source licenses confirms that while most licenses present few roadblocks, reciprocal licenses such as the GNU General Public License produce knotty constraints that cannot be effectively managed without analysis of the system's license architecture. Our automated tool supports intellectual property requirements management and license architecture evolution. We validate our approach on an existing heterogeneously-licensed system.
