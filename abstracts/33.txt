Modeling tools, as an instrument in support of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process, usually focus on a particular aspect, in a domain-agnostic manner. The tutorial discusses meta-modeling as an approach to over-come such shortcomings, enabling more holistic and specific semantic coverage of requirements models. The meta-modeling platform ADOxx is introduced as an experimentation environ-ment for researchers and practitioners to realize their individual modeling languages and functionality in support of RE. Specific emphasis is given to the practical nature of the tutori-al: participants are encouraged to build their individual model-ing tool in a hands-on setting and experiment with the capabili-ties of ADOxx to implement meta-models and model processing mechanisms, to specialize them or to integrate available assets provided by the ADOxx.org community.
