In many regulated domains, traceability is established across diverse artifacts such as requirements, design, code, test cases, and hazards â€“ either manually or with the help of supporting tools, and the resulting trace links are used to support activities such as impact analysis, compliance verification, and safety inspections. Automated tracing techniques need to leverage the semantics of underlying artifacts in order to establish more accurate trace links and to provide explanations of links that have been created in either a manual or automated fashion. To support this, we propose an automated technique which leverages source code, project artifacts and an external domain corpus to generate a domain-specific concept model. We then use the generated concept model to improve traceability results and to provide explanations of the results. Our approach overcomes existing problems with deep-learning traceability algorithms, as it does not require a training set of existing trace links. Finally, as an initial proof-of-concept, we apply our semantically-guided approach to the Dronology project, and show that it improves over other tracing techniques that do not use a concept model.
