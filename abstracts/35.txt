To overcome the impedance mismatch between requirement analysis and conceptual design, we introduce an intermediate step between the two phases, called conceptual pre-design. A (semantic) model for that phase should allow for an easy collection of requirements as well as for an unproblematic transformation of the collected requirements into entries of a conceptual scheme. We present a model that has been developed along these postulates. Following the classical DATA-ID approach, this model uses a "glossary metaphor" for scheme representation. It's basic semantic notions are 'thing type' and 'connection type'.
