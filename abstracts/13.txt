User feedback is valuable for the continued development of the system. Most of the user feedback analyzed today is explicit, such as app reviews. However, many users are reluctant to provide this explicit feedback, which costs them extra time. In this paper, we present an ongoing study, which investigates eye movement patterns with the purpose of automatically collecting users’ implicit feedback. Specifically, we establish the semantic connection between eye movements and users’ perceptions based on cognitive and empirical evidence. Our proposed approach can thus systematically assess the satisfaction of six non-functional requirements, quietly unveiling users’ needs for the software they use. Finally, we design an evaluation plan in order for assessing the effectiveness of our approach.
