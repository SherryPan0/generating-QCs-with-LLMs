Software requirements, rights, permissions, obligations, and operations of policy enforcing systems are often misaligned. Our goal is to develop tools and techniques that help requirements engineers and policy makers bring policies and system requirements into better alignment. Goals from requirements engineering are useful for distilling natural language policy statements into structured descriptions of these interactions; however, they are limited in that they are not easy to compare with one another despite sharing common semantic features. In this paper, we describe a process called semantic parameterization that we use to derive semantic models from goals mined from privacy policy documents. We present example semantic models that enable comparing policy statements and present a template method for generating natural language policy statements (and ultimately requirements) from unique semantic models. The semantic models are described by a context-free grammar called KTL that has been validated within the context of the most frequently expressed goals in over 100 Internet privacy policy documents. KTL is supported by a policy analysis tool that supports queries and policy statement generation.
